# TODO: Merge these into one


There are two samples in this directory, because previously, two different CS56 students or pairs 
created these examples.

That should be resolved by issue: #1

A todo item is to look at both, figure out which is better, and/or incorporate the best aspects of both, and merge
them into a single example.

The final example should have a nice build.xml, main programs that run everything, etc.

This is also referenced in an issue.  As part of resolving that issue, delete this README.md, or replace it with
appropriate content describing what the examples on p71-79 are all about.
