## Original Description

The code samples on pages 80-86 (from Chapter 4) are, for the most part, not in the context of an entire class, so there is no way to run them.

So, your job is to write a set of classes and main programs that allows all of the code on pages 80-86 to be actually run and demonstrated.

In addition, add Javadoc comments, an Ant build.xml file, and targets to run each of the examples.

Call your targets things like run80 run81 run82, etc.

Or, if there is more than one code example on a page, you can make names that make sense such as run83_1 run83_2 etc.

You'll need to use your imagination to come up with what to put along with the code---e.g. some output (System.out.println( ... what??? ) so that you can see that the code is doing something.
